    "In the game turns alternate between red and yellow colors, with each person dropping a token of their color into the column of their choice. The game board is verticle so the pieces drop down to the lowest slot in the column. Any player who positions 4 of the their color pieces in a row wins the game (verticle, horizontal, or diagonal directions are possible to make a 4 in-a-row). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this homework we will:\n",
    "- ensure turns alternate between red and yellow.\n",
    "- Ensure that the pieces 'drop' to the next lowest level in the slot (column) in which they were placed, and\n",
    "- Ensure users can only drop tokens into 1 of the 7 available columns\n",
    "- Make use of some helper code to draw the board and draw the tokens\n",

    "Your program should largely work now. Test it out by trying to play into variable columns. Ensure the tokens flip between red and yellow and stack on top of each other and you cannot play outside of the bounds. If it seems valid find a friend and see if you can play a game of connect-4. You'll just have to keep track yourself as to whether or not someone has won the game. "
