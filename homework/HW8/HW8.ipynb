We need to connect to a cloud file service to allow persistence. The following cell will connect Co-Lab to your Google Drive (prompting for a login) to allow persistence, you don't need to run this cell if you do not want to connect to google drive but your files will not persist when you revisit this page unless you save them somewhere persistent like google drive."

    "\n",
    "The suggested order to complete the functions is the order they are provided above. For example: complete the `add_contact` function first. The first 3 functions do not involve files or file input/output any interactions are with a dictionary where the key is the name of the contact and the value is their phone number. For example the `add_contact` function adds a contact to the dictionary where contacts live it does not add the contact to a file. The last 2 functions involve reading and/or writing to a file where the whole dictionary is either read from or written to file.\n",

    "If you change the way you store data in the file and your program keeps trying to open that file (and it is causing issues) you may need to delete the file to remove the old data and start over. The data is read and written from phonebook.txt: you can delete this file by clicking the file folder icon in the left side bar and then right-clicking phonebook.txt and selecting delete.\n",
